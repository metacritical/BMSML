    Right now it aims to be a Toy Interpreter,
    mostly a tree walker until the time i figure out how to write a VM, it wont have a GC.
    Atleast not initially, it aims to teach myself lisp interpreter by implementing one
    and at the same time becoming good at C , by writing more code in it.


    Reference: "Byte my shiny metal lisp" is a play on "Byte My Shiny Metal Ass", Favourite
    Catch phrase of "Bender Bending Rodrigues" the "Robot" character played in the animated TV series
